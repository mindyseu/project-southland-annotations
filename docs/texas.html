        I am not a solitary thinker, or solitary learner, or solitary channel of these universal wisdoms and universal truths. I’m constantly learning from other people. I weave. We all weave in different ways. What is the tapestry of lessons and wisdom that are unique for me? Each person ends up with a different tapestry, but you start to see patterns amongst them.

        Wildcard is an unknown or unpredictable factor. She shakes her head. “There aren’t anywhere near as many as there were. Kids today have no idea what a blaze of light cities used to be—and not that long ago.” <br>
        “I’d rather have the stars,” I say. <br>
        “The stars are free.” She shrugs. “I’d rather have the city lights back myself, the sooner the better. But we can afford the stars.”

        ‘Cause if at first you don't succeed… You can dust it off and try again. Dust yourself off and try again, try again again, again. The Female AF Collective have launched 7 unique NFT designs inspired by bad ass chicks from across history now known as; The Wildcard Women. Make a plugin that makes your phone ‘forget’ your fingerprint and only recognizes it on the second attempt, adding a 5-or-so minutes delay in retrying. So that you slow down and just sit there waiting, adding a glitch/an interruption/a disorienting yet reflective space somewhere-in-between..

        Today’s media consumer is more complicated than ever before. They don’t distinguish between TV, film, branded, or gaming content marketing – so long as it entertains them. That’s why we’ve assembled a highly-talented team of creators, strategists and innovators to develop work for this marketing reality. Here at Wild Card, we specialize in audiences, not industries.

        Generally speaking, people are good at making judgments regarding rules around proper communication. Shared ideas about who you can speak to, what to say and where you can say it are codified into social norms across cultures, including so-called mother-in-law languages that often require entirely separate vocabularies and forms of politesse, dictated by stringent rules of formality and informality.

        Love, <br>
        Its like a playing card <br>
        A wild card, <br>
        Your “lucky card”. <br>
        You throw it into play <br>
        Hoping it will land you your win. <br>
        You throw it wrong, <br>
        Your hand is forced <br>
        You have to fold- <br>
        But it hurts.

        Many local legends are actually well-known folktales that have become attached to some particular person or place. Wild Card Dun It, 2001 buckskin stallion, is a natural, intelligent, cooperative athlete that went to the top of the charts when he was in the show ring. Memories, even your most precious ones, fade surprisingly quickly. But I don’t go along with that. The memories I value most, I don’t ever see them fading.

        Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context – a chair in a room, a room, in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan. True ornament is not a matter of prettifying externals. It is organic with the structure it adorns, whether a person, a building or a park. At its best it is an emphasis of structure, a realization in graceful terms of the nature of what which is ornamented.

        Publishers faced prosecution for violation of the obscenity laws put in place during the 20th century. A practical solution was to substitute certain letters with other characters. The words? Shit, fuck, piss, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. Everyone knows there’s something not quite right about suburban sprawl: the deserts of plywood spreading over hayfields; the kids getting fat eating potato chips in front of TV; the creeping lure of the affordable dream house that comes in the same four basic plans no matter where you are.

        But the houses are big, beautiful, white, more than you ever expected to have. More than you can resist. Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn. Bowlderize is used to “cleanse” vulgar text by omitting or modifying certain parts.

        And every time I've held a rose <br>
        It seems I only felt the thorns <br>
        And so it goes, and so it goes <br>
        And so will you, soon, I suppose <br>

        It hides nothing.

        Either way things turn out to be not what you thought they were. Beginning of the end or the end of the beginning.
